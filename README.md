First, install the required libraries:

pip install psutil setproctitle

Use the following Python code to search for a process by its name and continuously rename the process string

Explanation:

    random_hex_string: This function generates a random hexadecimal string of length 12 using Python's random.choice and a loop that picks characters from the set 0123456789abcdef.

    setproctitle: The setproctitle function from the setproctitle package is used to set the current process's title (its name). This is what will allow you to rename the process.

    Loop: The program runs continuously in an infinite loop (using while True), and every second, it generates a new random hexadecimal string of length 12 and sets it as the process name using setproctitle. The name is printed for debugging purposes.

    Interrupt Handling: The program can be stopped manually with Ctrl+C (this will raise a KeyboardInterrupt), and in that case, it will stop renaming the process and exit gracefully.

Important Notes:

    Platform Dependency: This script will work for Unix-like systems (Linux/macOS). On Windows, you can't rename the process string as easily in the same way. Windows handles process naming differently.
    Permission: Depending on the environment, you might need to run the script with appropriate permissions (e.g., with root/sudo privileges on some systems).
